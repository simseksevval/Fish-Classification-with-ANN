# Fish Classification with ANN
The goal of this project is to develop a classification model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to accurately identify and categorize various species of fish based on their images. With a dataset comprising 9 different fish species, each containing 1000 PNG images, this project aims to leverage the capabilities of neural networks in image recognition.
